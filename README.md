# alfred_cowsay_workflow
This is an Alfred workflow. It integrates cowsay ASCII image generator command with [alfred productivity tool](https://www.alfredapp.com/) for Mac OS X.

This workflow triggers the cowsay command with user provided message and displays the output as a large banner which covers the entire screen. Additionally the cowsay output gets copied to clipboard. 

**Prerequisite:**
This workflow assumes that **cowsay** is already installed and available at /usr/local/bin/cowsay. If its not already installed, please [install it using brew](http://macappstore.org/cowsay/ "install cowsay in Mac") and then import this workflow.

**See it in action:**
